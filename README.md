# balena-sensors-dht
balena.io DHT sensor reading with Python3 &amp; Adafruit_DHT

You can use it to read DHT11, DHT22 and AM2302 sensors.

I am using it on a raspberry pi 2, however you can probably use it on other devices as well - just change the Docker image (FROM balenalib/raspberry-pi2-python:build)
